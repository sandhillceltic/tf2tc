Program : Steam Uber Tracker
Notes :

The name of this needs to be changed eventually, as the program has nothing to do with steam.
Something to do with Team Fortress 2 would be more accurate.
This is the first build of the server that does next to nothing besides accepting a connection.
It will also be used to see if the port is listening, so that I can go back and reassign the port.
